# vba-challenge

This is the read-me file being added for the 2nd Challenge VBA Script.

- A summary per year on every Ticker has been added, showing the Ticker name, Yearly Change, Percentage Change and also the Total Stock Volume

- Another table on the right side of the summary was added to show the Greatest Percentage Increase, Greatest Percentage Decrease and Greates Total Volume showing the ticker and the totals accordingly.

The code source has been a mixture of Stack Overflow, Microsoft Community, Wall Street Mojo and got help multiple times from "AskBCS Learning Assistance" Unathi, Bigyan, Ian, Angel and Daniel; they helped tremendously.
